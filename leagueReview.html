<h1>Black and White Simulator - Running since 2009</h1>
<p>
A Polite review of league of legends.
So some blokes got together and made a game that got popular and is pretty big in the esports scene, doesn’t mean it’s any good. They made some real weird champs like Bard who can make tunnels through walls. Someone then screamed at the top of their lungs and made kayn, who doesn’t need the tunnel.
The game is perfectly balanced. I enjoy playing in black and white when the enemy has an assassin. Rengar is a joy to be playing against and with, you’ll never get a kill but neither will they after the 10 minute mark. Hecarim gets his own rune that makes people disappear as soon as he gets himself a fresh pair of yeezys.</br>
The game has simple mechanics that can be used in complicated ways. The game also has a difficulty slider which scales from co-op vs Ai to trying to get your desired role in blind pick without some random person instalocking before you’ve even loaded in.
    The game has 5 roles 4 of which are playable:</br>
Top (Playable)</br>
Mid (Playable)</br>
Jungle (Playable)</br>
Support <span style= color:blue;>(Playable but only if your favourite parts of highschool was getting shouted at by your teachers)</span></br>
ADC <span style= color:blue;>(unplayable unless your definition of being able to play the game is getting delted faster than the internet history of someone who is getting visited by their parents.)</span></br>
    
    Games usually revolve around 1 or 2 people getting a lot of kills and rampaging throughout the map with the style and elegance only challenged by that of a steamroller. An example of this pure style, skill and elegance would be <span style=color:red;>Rengar</span> with his <span style= color:red; class="footnote">wonderfull</span> point click delete.
